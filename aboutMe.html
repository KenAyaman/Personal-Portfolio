                    <p> I am Ken Ayaman and I'm still young and yet ready to mingle. I am a student of University of the Cordilleras (UC), in the course of Information Technology. 
                    I learned about some basic coding when it comes to Information Technology, so if you want me to repair your washing machine please don't call me. </p>

                    <h6>Music</h6>
                    <p> Although I have a wide range of preferences, music is what truly piques my interest. The band "IV of Spades" has extremely unique and free-form music, which is why I truly enjoy listening to it.
                        My hobby has a musical aspect as well, and that is playing instruments, it is one of my favourite pastimes.</p>
